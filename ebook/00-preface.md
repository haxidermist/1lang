# Preface

The 1 programming language is a new language designed with a revolutionary premise: that syntax itself should be programmable. Where traditional languages fix their notation at design time, 1 allows programs to manipulate and extend the very syntax they are written in.

This book is meant to help the reader learn how to program in 1. It contains a tutorial introduction to get started, separate chapters on each major feature, and a reference manual. Most of the presentation is based on reading, writing, and revising examples, rather than on mere statements of rules. For the most part, the examples are complete, real programs rather than isolated fragments. All examples have been tested directly from the text, which is in machine-readable form.

The book is organized as follows. Chapter 1 is a tutorial introduction that covers the major features of 1 through practical examples. The purpose of this chapter is to show the essential elements of the language in real programs, but without getting bogged down in details, rules, and exceptions. The tutorial does assume a basic familiarity with programming concepts; there is no explanation of computers, of compilation, or of the meaning of terms like variable and assignment statement.

Chapters 2 through 4 discuss various aspects of 1 in more detail, and rather more formally, than does Chapter 1. Chapter 2 deals with the basic data types, operators and expressions. Chapter 3 treats control flow: if-else, while, for, and the ensure-otherwise construct. Chapter 4 covers functions and program structure—external variables, scope rules, and so on.

Chapter 5 discusses the key innovation of 1: programmable syntax. This chapter shows how block delimiters can be treated as data, how syntax can be extended and modified, and how programs can manipulate their own notation.

Chapter 6 describes the self-hosting compiler—how 1 can compile itself, and what this means for the language and its future development.

The Appendix is a language reference manual that provides a precise definition of the language. The official syntax is described here, though the programmable nature of 1 means that programs can define their own syntax extensions.

## Acknowledgments

The 1 language emerged from an intensive collaboration between human insight and artificial intelligence. The bootstrap compiler was developed in Python to demonstrate the feasibility of the core ideas. The self-hosting components prove that the language can process itself.

This book follows the model established by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie in their classic work, "The C Programming Language." Their clear, practical approach to teaching a programming language through examples has proven timeless and is emulated here.

## A Note on Exercises

Each chapter concludes with a series of exercises. These exercises suggest practical programs of varying difficulty, from simple applications of material in the chapter to more challenging problems that extend concepts or introduce new ideas. Solutions to exercises are not provided; working through them is the best way to learn the language.
